Instead of drafting players, NFL teams are drafted. Win and loss totals for the teams are added up and the person with the most total wins at the season wins the league.

== Features
multiple leagues
start/bench teams
auto-updating records (of nfl teams and users) after game is over


== TODO

Draft functionality
